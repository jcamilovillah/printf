_In this project we will develop the activity **0x11. C - printf** from **Holberton School**. In which we had to develop a printf with all its characteristics; including type of format, length modifiers, etc._

## Project information üöÄ

_Below, additional information that we had to take into account in order to develop the project, such as requirements and resources, will be presented. As well as the contact of the developers of this project._

### Requeriments üìå
